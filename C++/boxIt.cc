/*
Design a class named Box whose dimensions are integers and private to the class. 
The dimensions are labelled: length l, breadth b, and height h.

The default constructor of the class should initialize l, b, and h to 0.

The parameterized constructor Box(int length, int breadth, int height) should 
initialize Box's l, b and h to length, breadth and height.

The copy constructor BoxBox ) should set l, b and h to B's l, b, and h, respectively.

Apart from the above, the class should have 4 functions:

int getLength() - Return box's length
int getBreadth() - Return box's breadth
int getHeight() - Return box's height
long long CalculateVolume() - Return the volume of the box
