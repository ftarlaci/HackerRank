/*

You’re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and an integer 
to add to the list. Create a new node with the given integer, insert this 
node at the head of the linked list and return the new head node. The head 
pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

Input Format

You have to complete the SinglyLinkedListNode Insert(SinglyLinkedListNode head, 
int data) method which takes two arguments - the head of the linked list and the 
integer to insert. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console.

The input is handled by code in the editor and is as follows:

The first line contains an integer , denoting the number of elements to be 
inserted at the head of the list. 
The next  lines contain an integer each, denoting the element to be inserted.

        llist = newHead;
    } else {
        newHead->next = llist;
        llist = newHead;
    }
    return llist;  // not sure what is wrong, passing for now
